I'm a software engineer fresh out of school, now living and working in NYC. 

I have a passion for data science and the communication of information in data through
visualizations. I'm learning R as I go to create more insightful and beautiful graphics. My goal is that my work
is honest and transparent, using only reliable and trustworthy sources for data. I never
intentionally skew or obscure my graphics to mislead or manipulate. If you don't believe me, I always list my sources at
the bottom of my graphics (when the data is public), and the source code is open on my Github page and linked to in
each post. Reach out to me if you have any suggestions for future graphics!

Feel free to share and distribute my work any way you like, but please remember to give credit.

I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science from Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in 2017.
